                The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical objects—devices, vehicles,
                buildings and other items—embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and network
                connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data.

<!-- This skin is already being stitched together.
                    It consists of millions of embedded electronic measuring devices:
                    thermostats, pressure gauges, pollution detectors, cameras, microphones,
                    glucose sensors, EKGs, electroencephalographs. These will probe and monitor
                    cities and endangered species, the atmosphere, our ships, highways and
                    fleets of trucks, our conversations, our bodies--even our dreams.-->
